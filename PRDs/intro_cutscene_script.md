Script: Opening Cutscene - "The Satoshi Inheritance"
Scene 1: The Boot Sequence
Visuals: A pitch-black screen. A single emerald-green cursor blinks in the top-left corner. The sound is high-speed mechanical typing (the "Data-Scroll" SFX).

Terminal: [BOOTING LEGACY_RECOVERY_v4.2...]

Terminal: [LOADED MODULE: HEURISTIC_BRUTEFORCE_v0.11]

Terminal: [TARGET: BLOCK_000000000019D668]

Terminal: [ATTEMPTING 10,442,891,012 COMBINATIONS...]

Scene 2: The Breakthrough
Visuals: The screen begins to flicker with rapid-fire hex codes. The blinking cursor turns from green to a pulsing Warning Red, then suddenly freezes.

SFX: A low, resonant bass drop (The "Eureka" sound).

Terminal: [!] ERROR: COLLISION DETECTED.

Terminal: [!] PRIVATE KEY RECOVERED.

Terminal: [SYSTEM]: ACCESSING WALLET: "SATOSHI_ANON_2009"

Terminal: [SYSTEM]: CURRENT MARKET VALUE: $100,000,000.00 USD (ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION)

Scene 3: The Global Alert
Visuals: The terminal text starts scrolling at a violent speed. New, aggressive red text overlaps the emerald green.

Terminal: [ALERT]: BLOCKCHAIN TRACER ACTIVE.

Terminal: [ALERT]: INTERPOL DIGITAL ASSET TASK FORCE NOTIFIED.

Terminal: [ALERT]: GEOLOCATING IP... 82.12.19.4...

Terminal: [SYSTEM]: USER "DESTITUTE_99" STATUS: WANTED.

Scene 4: The Pivot
Visuals: The "Liquid Glass" HUD starts to bleed in over the terminal. The gritty green text is replaced by your sleek Command Blue interface. The camera pans up from a dusty, dark room in a high-rise slum to look through a cracked window toward the stars.

Narrator (Protagonist's internal thought): "They call it digital grave robbing. I call it an inheritance. They can track me on Earth, but there are no cops in the Belt. If I want to keep this, I have to go where the laws don't apply."

Scene 5: Launching Act 1
Visuals: The screen clears. You see the high-fidelity 3D Earth in the center. The "Money" element in the West Wing pulses as the $100M is deposited.

Ground Control (AI Assistant - First Popup): "I am 'Echo', your legacy AI. The transfer is complete, but the authorities are closing in. If we are going to survive, we need to stop looking at the dirt and start looking at the rocks. Shall we begin the Scan?"
